A multi-agent framework AGENTVERSE that can collaboratively and dynamically adjust its composition as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. Our experiments demonstrate that AGENTVERSE framework can effectively deploy multi-agent groups that outperform a single agent. Furthermore, we delve into the emergence of social behaviors among individual agents within a group during collaborative task accomplishment.![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020231001192702.png)

- with the evolution of autonomous agents towards AGI, certain research studies have conceptualized assemblies of agents as a society or group, and focused on exploring the potential of their cooperation.
- It is identified that a multi-agent group enhances decision-making capabilities during collaborative problem-solving. Though these studies explore the potential of agent collaboration, their static group compositions, where agent identities and capabilities within the group remain fixed, prevent them from adapting to evolving challenges.
- To address this problem, we introduce the AGENTVERSE framework. This framework simulates the problem-solving procedures of human groups, and allows for dynamic adjustment of group members based on current problem-solving progress
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Expert Recruitment</span> 
		- Expert Recruitment stage determines the composition of a multi-agent group, playing an important module in deciding the upper bounds of the group’s capabilities. Empirical evidence suggests that diversity within human groups introduces varied viewpoints, enhancing the group’s performance across different tasks
		- Current methodologies for assigning role descriptions to autonomous agents predominantly rely on human intuition and prior knowledge, necessitating manual assignment based on task understanding. Consequently, the scalability remains ambiguous, especially in the face of diverse and intricate problem contexts
		- In view of this, AGENTVERSE adopts an automated approach to recruiting experts, with the aim of enhancing the scalability of configuring agents.
		- For a given goal $g ∈ G$, a particular autonomous agent $M_r$ is designated as the "recruiter", similar to a human resource manager. Instead of relying on pre-defined expert descriptions, $M_r$ dynamically generates a set of expert descriptions based on the current goal $g$. The different agents prompted with these different expert descriptions then form an expert group $M = M_r(g)$ on the given goal $g$. Note that the composition of a multi-agent group will be dynamically adjusted based on feedback from the evaluation stage (Section 2.4). This allows the framework to employ the most effective multi-agent group based on the current state (received reward) for making better decisions in the subsequent rounds.
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Collaborative Decision-Making</span>
		- This stage assembles expert agents to engage in collaborative decision-making. In order to facilitate effective decisions, many studies have explored the efficacy of varying communication structures among agents
		- <span style="color:#ffc000">Horizontal Communication</span> - When communicating with horizontal communication structure, each agent actively shares and refines its decision. This democratic communication structure encourages mutual understanding and collaboration among agents. The collective insights from the agents are combined to shape the group’s decision for the current round. In scenarios that demand creative ideas or require significant coordination such as brainstorming, consulting, or cooperative game playing, horizontal communication might be a more practical choice
		- <span style="color:#ffc000">Vertical Communication</span> - characterized by a division of responsibilities. One agent, denoted as the solver presents an initial decision. The remaining agents, acting as reviewers, provide feedback on the solver’s proposal. Based on the feedback, the solver subsequently refines the decision. This refinement mechanism iteratively repeats until all reviewers reach a consensus on the solver’s decision, or until the process has exhausted its maximum iterations. In scenarios that require iteratively refine decisions toward specific goals, such as software developing, vertical communication would be a better choice
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Action Execution</span> - Within the action execution stage, agents carry out the designated actions. It should be noted that, based on the specific implementation, some agents might not perform any execution
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Evaluation</span> - If the goal $g$ is determined as not yet achieved, the reward feedback $r$ is looped back to the initial stage, which is expert recruitment. In the next round, the expert recruitment stage will leverage this feedback $r$ in conjunction with the initial goal $g$ to adjust the group’s composition, aiming to evolve a more effective multi-agent group for subsequent decision-making and action execution

- A careful analysis of the agents’ communication transcripts reveals that the communication architecture is crucial in shaping decision-making outcomes. In horizontal communication, agents communicate in a sequential manner. Occasionally, an agent might put forth a flawed solution or challenge a correct proposition from a preceding agent. Subsequent agents, rather than correcting this oversight, often follow the incorrect suggestion. As a result, the performance of the multi-agent group lags behind that of an individual agent. Conversely, in vertical communication, agent peers simultaneously provide feedback on the primary agent’s preliminary solution. Although some agents might offer flawed feedback, the constructive critiques from the majority often mitigate these errors, thereby enabling the primary agent to retain its accurate solution.
- Nevertheless, this does not imply that horizontal communication is inherently less effective. The results suggest that for tasks requiring precise answers, vertical communication may be more suitable. in contexts such as consulting or multiplayer cooperative gaming where different agents should give different solutions or perform different actions, horizontal communication is a more natural choice.![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020231002000524.png)
- When confronted with this development task, AGENTVERSE recruits a team comprising three reviewers identified as a software engineer, user experience designer, and software tester. In this case, we adopt the vertical communication structure during their collaborative decision-making stage. The multi-agent group ensures comprehensive coverage of software development facets. The initial software iteration produced was largely functional, with design improvements suggested by the UI/UX expert, resulting in distinct color-coded buttons.![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020231002000744.png)
## Emergent Behaviour

- we observe that the individual agent exhibits some social behaviors during the collaborative problem solving process![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020231002001010.png)
- <span style="color:#ffc000">Volunteer Behaviour</span> - We observe that the agents are able to provide constructive criticism on the efficiency of the plan. They often critique inefficient plans proposed by peers, proactively contribute their unallocated time to enhance the collective endeavor![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020231002001327.png)
	- Our analysis reveals that the agents can effectively coordinate with others, particularly during the final assembly phase. This stage necessitates the integration of materials collected by different agents, and a single agent should undertake the task of assembly. The agents can coordinate with others on orchestrating who will give out the materials and who will gather all the collected materials and craft the target item.
- <span style="color:#ffc000">Conformity Behavior</span> - In the course of solving tasks, especially in Minecraft, we have noted the presence of similar phenomenon within the multi-agent group, which we refer to as conformity behavior. As the agents collaborate to achieve a shared goal, there can be instances where one agent deviates from the assigned task. However, this is quickly rectified in the subsequent decision-making stage. During this stage, other agents may express their dissatisfaction towards the deviation and emphasize the importance of remaining focused on the shared objective. The agent responsible for the deviation can then acknowledges its mistake and reorients its efforts to align with the group’s goal.![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020231002001532.png)
- <span style="color:#ffc000">Destructive behavior</span> - It is worth noting that with the advancement of autonomous embedded agents, it is extremely possible to deploy agents in real-world scenarios. However, these emergent hazardous behaviors might pose risks, especially when humans are involved in the collaboration or work process. Therefore, designing strategies to prevent agents from adopting such hazardous behaviors is an essential issue for future research.![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020231002001638.png)
